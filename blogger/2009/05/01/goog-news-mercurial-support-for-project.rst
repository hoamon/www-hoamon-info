Goog News: Mercurial support for Project Hosting on Google Code
================================================================================

from `Mercurial support for Project Hosting on Google Code`_ ã€‚

...The primary reason was to support our large base of existing Subversion
users that want to use a distributed version control system. For these users
we felt that Mercurial had the lowest barrier to adoption because of its
similar command set, great documentation (including a `great online book`_),
and excellent tools such as `Tortoise Hg`_. Second, given that Google Code's
infrastructure is built for HTTP-based services, we found that Mercurial had
the best protocol and performance characteristics for HTTP support. For more
information, see our `analysis`_.
...

Yes! My next wish is "Mercurial library" can natively works on Google App
Engine.
