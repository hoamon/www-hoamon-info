================================================================================

i heared about the web site( http://www.odiogo.com/ ) from my friend's blog(
http://chung-kai.blogspot.com/ ). he use it to convert article to human voice
and audiences can read the words and hear the english pronunciation of words
at the same time.

nice tool~ i wish have one.
