add empty directory in the Mercurial
================================================================================

I lost a lot time to add directory in the Mercurial, because Mercurial can't
add empty directory to the working base. I search some many web pages to find
out how, and the answer is so simple: put a file in the empty directory, and
hg add xxxDir.

i lost one hour for that.
