About This Site
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of this site's style that is the top and both sides have bright black words
written in the red background was i copied from Chinese.  People decorate their
front door with the red scrolls in the eve of Chinese New Year is a tradition.
The right, left, top scrolls constitute Chinese Spring Festival Scrolls.
The right scroll means "To learn without thinking is blindness".
The left scroll explains "To think without learning is idleness".
This two scrolls cited from Confucius.  And the top sentence i made is expressing
"Focus on both learning and thinking to demonstrate ethics".
They always remind me to be clever and smart in attending to affairs.

This website was born in the some day of the second millennium.  Meanwhile,
a big internet wave slapped to everyone.  Inevitably i bought a domain name from
`Hinet.net <http://www.hinet.net/>`_ in Taiwan, too.  It was named Amon.idv.tw.
On 15 December 2006, i registered a more globalizing domain was called
`hoamon.info <http://www.hoamon.info/>`_ from
`Godaddy.com <http://www.godaddy.com/>`_ .

The first version of this site was wrote in pure html.  According to time sequence,
the other after versions were programmed with Perl CGI, PHP, Python CGI( with Django ),
`Python on Google App Engine
<https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/overview>`_ .
Now, i decided to change the construction tools of this site from custom to
`Google Sites <https://sites.google.com/>`_ service because Google has the full
feature web design tool.
The changing frequency of this site was very low because my status of life
phase was transformed slowly,  it is not worth to maintain a program project to
display my details.

**But** after few days, i realized the Google Sites is not suited for a web programmer,
because it's too simple to a person who has crazy love on programming.
So i changed to use `Python-Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ to generate my websites.
Sphinx is a reStructuredText-based documental generating tool which
mainly apply to software project. I can treat the web page as a source code that
lay on a `Mercurial <http://mercurial.selenic.com/>`_ repository
( I set my personal website in a open source project is
hosted on http://bitbucket.org/hoamon/www-hoamon-info, and the licenses is BSD ).

The purpose of my detail page is only one describes who i am, and using the same
content in ten different languages: English, 正體中文, español, 日本語, português,
Deutsch, العربية( Arabic ), français, русский, 한국의.
The list is sorted by the language usage amount of the world wide web(
`2010, Top 10 Languages used in the internet
<http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm>`_ ).

About Me
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My English nickname is "Amon"(pronounce as A :del:`pple` + :del:`si` mon) and the internet ID is "hoamon", this name was came
from an evil vampire(Antonio Banderas) of the movie: "Interview with the vampire".
But a few years later, i found this was a mistake, his name should be "Armand".
Although it is a wrong name,  this still can remind me to read a lot,
because this name is the same as a Chinese general in history of the Three Kingdoms.

My Chinese born name is 何岳峰. If you have no appropriate font on the OS,
|ho-yueh-feng| is the image you can see.

.. |ho-yueh-feng| image:: _static/ho-yueh-feng.png

My English name(in transliteration) is \
Ho, Yueh-Feng that only used in official document like bank account, passport,
credit card, journal and thesis.

Resume
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a positive attitude to do every work, don't be afraid to ask questions
and gladly share knowledge to my colleagues.  My character is to be neither
jealous nor greedy.  I rode into the road of programming and system management
for a reason which is command from my advisor.  He asked me to build a web site
in the second year of graduate institute.  So i dive into this mass from ASP+IIS
to PHP+Apache, and then Linux, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Perl, Python, Django,
Google App Engine, Amazon Web Service.  It(Open Source) totally open my eye view.

High Performance Concrete Using Levenberg-Marquardt Genetic Operation Tree**.

I have three job experiences until now.  First one was a network administrator
charged to manage the systems of RADIUS, NAT, File sharing, Source Version Control,
DB.  And i also wrote some web program, like wi-fi service payment system.

General Interests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are many things i dived into, for example, reading English book to pretend
my good English level, chatting everything with others, strolling in library
and book store to be a fake literary youth.  However, now be lost in world of
open source, and dream to improve everyone's life with it and enhance their
confidence to make them be hackers.  To limit the scope, i will say the reading
is my best favor.  Finance, Science Management, Mathematics, Computer Science,
Computer Programming and History are my major reading.

After thirty, i was loved to exercise.  Jogging is usually one, the second is cycling,
and the others are swimming and hiking(short-distance climbing).
And joined three regular competition:
`2011 Marathon in Nantou <http://blog.hoamon.info/2012/01/2011.html>`_ ,
`2010 Triathlon in Taitung <http://blog.hoamon.info/2010/10/2010-515k.html>`_ and
2012 Triathlon in Taitung.
